This was a project my friend and I worked on over a summer in 2014.  We wanted to make a text-adventure game with lots of mutations, exploration, and a little combat.  We made some design documents and got to work.  After a few months we abandoned it due to other responsibilities and the scope being too large.  Iâ€™d like to revisit the idea of Mutate LA someday though.
